# From .NET to Next.js: A Developer's Journey

After spending 7 years in the .NET ecosystem, I decided to explore the world of modern web development with Next.js. Here's my journey and what I've learned along the way.

## Why Next.js?

Coming from a .NET background, I was looking for a framework that offered:
- Strong conventions (like ASP.NET MVC)
- Built-in routing (similar to ASP.NET routing)
- Server-side capabilities (like .NET Web API)

Next.js checked all these boxes and more.

## Familiar Concepts

Many concepts translate well between .NET and Next.js:

| .NET                 | Next.js              |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Controllers          | Page Components      |
| _Layout.cshtml       | layout.tsx           |
| Partial Views        | React Components     |
| Middleware           | Middleware           |
| API Controllers      | API Routes           |

## Code Examples

Here's a simple comparison between .NET and Next.js routing:

```csharp
// .NET Controller
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

```typescript
// Next.js Page
export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## What I've Learned So Far

1. Component-based thinking is different from template-based views
2. JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem is vast but manageable
3. The development experience is surprisingly smooth
4. Hot reloading is a game-changer for productivity

## Next Steps

I'm continuing to build out this portfolio site and learning more about:
- State management in React
- Server Components in Next.js
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey!
